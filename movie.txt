**THE SINGLE SOLDIER ATTEMPT - SCREENPLAY (REVISED)**

---

**EXT. SIEGE CAMP - DAY**

The camp sprawls below Harlech Castle. HERBERT (late 20s, well-dressed, intense eyes) stands with his MASTER-AT-ARMS (40s, weathered) and THOMAS (30s, engineer) studying the fortress.

**HERBERT**  
Bring me a soldier. One of the Welsh levies.

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
My lord?

**HERBERT**  
I want to try something. Just one man.

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
(carefully)  
What would you have him do, my lord?

**HERBERT**  
Take the castle.

Beat. Thomas and the Master-at-Arms stare at him.

**THOMAS**  
My lord... one man cannot—

**HERBERT**  
I know. But I want to see what happens when he tries.

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
You want to send one man... against fifty defenders... to observe his attempt?

**HERBERT**  
(nodding, matter-of-fact)  
Exactly. By any means necessary. Climb, swim, whatever he thinks might work. Just... try it.

The Master-at-Arms and Thomas exchange troubled glances.

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
My lord, that's—

**HERBERT**  
(not unkindly)  
It's an order.

---

**EXT. SIEGE CAMP - PRISON AREA - LATER**

GRUFFYDD (mid-20s, thin, desperate eyes) sits in the dirt, wrists bound. A Welsh scout caught carrying messages to the castle weeks ago. The Master-at-Arms approaches with two guards.

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
On your feet.

Gruffydd stands, confused and frightened. They march him through camp.

---

**EXT. HERBERT'S COMMAND TENT - CONTINUOUS**

Gruffydd is brought before Herbert, who studies him like he's examining a horse.

**HERBERT**  
You're Gruffydd? The scout?

**GRUFFYDD**  
(in Welsh, through INTERPRETER)  
Yes, my lord.

**HERBERT**  
You know the castle. You've been inside.

**GRUFFYDD**  
(wary)  
...Yes, my lord.

**HERBERT**  
Good. I'm giving you a chance to earn your life. Take the castle.

Long silence. Gruffydd stares at Herbert, not understanding.

**GRUFFYDD**  
Take... my lord, I don't understand. Take it how? With what men?

**HERBERT**  
Just you. By any means you can think of. Climb, swim, sneak in, however you think best. If you succeed, you're free. Your family receives gold.

Gruffydd's face shows he understands this is death.

**GRUFFYDD**  
My lord, one man cannot—

**HERBERT**  
You're welcome to try anything. I won't tell you how. That's the point.

**GRUFFYDD**  
(voice rising, in Welsh)  
My lord, this is murder! I have daughters! This is—

**HERBERT**  
(to interpreter)  
Tell him if he refuses, he hangs today. If he tries, his family receives compensation regardless of outcome.

The interpreter translates. Gruffydd sags.

**HERBERT (CONT'D)**  
(genuinely)  
I really don't mind if you die. But you should do everything you can to succeed. That's the interesting part.

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
(quietly)  
My lord...

**HERBERT**  
(to Gruffydd)  
You have until sunset. Choose your approach.

---

**EXT. BEACH BELOW HARLECH - LATE AFTERNOON**

Gruffydd stands at the base of the cliff, looking up. He's chosen the sea stairs—the only approach that might give him any chance at all. Herbert, Thomas, and officers watch from a distance with spyglasses.

Gruffydd looks back at them one last time. No help is coming. He crosses himself, begins climbing.

**HERBERT**  
(excited, to Thomas)  
He chose the stairs. Smart. The cliff face would be impossible, and swimming to the water gate is too exposed.

**THOMAS**  
My lord, this is—

**HERBERT**  
Watch. I want to see how long before they notice him.

---

**EXT. THE SEA STAIRS - CONTINUOUS**

Gruffydd climbs steadily, trying to stay close to the cliff wall. Each step is worn smooth. Wind whips at him. His hands shake.

30 feet up. 50 feet.

A VOICE calls down in Welsh from above.

**WELSH DEFENDER (O.S.)**  
(subtitled)  
Go back, boy. We see you.

Gruffydd stops. Looks down at the beach where Herbert watches. Looks up at the castle.

He can't go back. Herbert won't let him.

He keeps climbing.

**WELSH DEFENDER (O.S.) (CONT'D)**  
(subtitled)  
Last chance!

70 feet up now. Gruffydd's breathing is ragged, tears streaming down his face.

THUNK. An arrow embeds itself in the stone two feet from his head.

---

**EXT. BEACH BELOW - CONTINUOUS**

Herbert leans forward, intensely focused.

**HERBERT**  
They gave him two warnings before shooting. Interesting. They could have killed him immediately.

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
(voice tight)  
They're not murderers.

**HERBERT**  
(missing the implication)  
No, it's more than that. They're conserving arrows, or perhaps trying not to antagonize us. Note that.

Thomas writes reluctantly.

---

**EXT. THE SEA STAIRS - CONTINUOUS**

Gruffydd keeps climbing. He has no choice.

Another arrow. This one punches through his shoulder. He screams, staggers. Blood pours down his arm.

He tries to keep going. One more step. Another.

A third arrow takes him in the leg. He collapses onto the stairs.

Above him, the DEFENDERS watch. One has another arrow nocked but doesn't fire.

---

**EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS**

Through the spyglass: Gruffydd lying on the stairs, trying to crawl.

**HERBERT**  
They're letting him retreat. Why? Mercy? Or sending a message?

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
(breaking)  
Because they're not monsters. Unlike—

He stops himself. Herbert looks at him, curious.

**HERBERT**  
Unlike what?

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
(through gritted teeth)  
Nothing, my lord.

---

**EXT. THE SEA STAIRS - SUNSET (TWO HOURS LATER)**

Gruffydd has crawled maybe 50 feet down. Each movement is agony. He leaves a blood trail on the ancient stones.

The defenders watch but don't shoot again.

Herbert watches through his spyglass the entire time, occasionally making notes.

---

**EXT. BEACH - DUSK**

Gruffydd finally reaches the bottom, collapses. Soldiers rush forward.

Herbert walks over, kneels beside him. Gruffydd is barely conscious, face gray from blood loss.

**HERBERT**  
Take him to the infirmary.

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
(bitter)  
Your mercy is noted, my lord.

**HERBERT**  
(genuinely confused)  
What? He tried his best. That's all I asked.

Herbert stands, looks back up at the castle stairs, making notes.

**HERBERT (CONT'D)**  
The approach is viable with proper equipment. The defenders show restraint. Their fields of fire are excellent but not complete coverage. This was very useful.

The soldiers carrying Gruffydd's stretcher hurry past. One meets the Master-at-Arms' eyes—disgust clear.

Herbert doesn't notice. He's already thinking about the next test.

**HERBERT (CONT'D)**  
(to Thomas)  
Tomorrow we'll try the covered mantlet approach. I have some ideas about the angle...

He walks back toward camp, animated and satisfied.

The Master-at-Arms watches him go, then looks at the blood trail on the stairs.

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
(to himself)  
God help us.

FADE OUT.

END SCENE

**THE MANTLET FAILURES - SCREENPLAY**

---

**INT. HERBERT'S COMMAND TENT - DAY**

Thomas spreads drawings across a table. Herbert, the Master-at-Arms, and SIR EDMUND (50s, experienced knight) study them. The mood is tense after Gruffydd's death two days ago.

**THOMAS**  
A mobile shield, essentially. Eight feet tall, four feet wide. Thick oak planks. Four men carry it up the stairs ahead of them.

**HERBERT**  
(excited)  
It protects them from arrows while they ascend.

**SIR EDMUND**  
My lord, the weight. On those steep stairs, carrying that and climbing—

**HERBERT**  
That's why we test it. To see what happens.

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
And when the defenders drop stones on it?

**HERBERT**  
(genuinely curious)  
Will it hold? How much weight before it fails? That's what we need to find out.

Beat. The officers realize he's serious.

**THOMAS**  
(carefully)  
My lord, perhaps we start with a smaller test? Lighter weight, fewer men?

**HERBERT**  
No, we need to know if the real approach works. Full scale.

He looks at their faces, sees their resistance.

**HERBERT (CONT'D)**  
(not unkindly)  
Build it. Find volunteers.

---

**EXT. SIEGE CAMP - CARPENTER'S AREA - MONTAGE**

Thomas and carpenters construct the mantlet over three days. Herbert visits constantly, checking thickness, reinforcement. His enthusiasm contrasts with the carpenters' grim efficiency.

---

**EXT. BEACH BELOW HARLECH - DAY**

Four MEN-AT-ARMS stand with the completed mantlet. It's massive, crude but solid. They hoist it with difficulty.

Herbert watches with his spyglass from a safe distance. Officers stand with him, somber.

**HERBERT**  
(to Master-at-Arms)  
Signal them to begin.

The flag drops. The four men start up the stairs, the mantlet held in front of them like a massive door.

---

**EXT. THE SEA STAIRS - CONTINUOUS**

The men climb slowly. The mantlet is incredibly heavy. Their breathing is already labored at 30 feet.

**MAN-AT-ARMS #1**  
(straining)  
Steady... steady...

50 feet up. The stairs narrow slightly. The mantlet scrapes the cliff face on one side.

Above them, DEFENDERS watch from the walls.

---

**EXT. HARLECH CASTLE WALLS - CONTINUOUS**

Three Welsh defenders peer down at the ascending mantlet. One, older, seems to be in charge—DAFYDD AP IEUAN (40s, weathered, determined).

**DAFYDD**  
(in Welsh, subtitled)  
Stones. Don't waste arrows on wood.

Defenders lift a large stone—maybe 40 pounds—and position it at the edge.

---

**EXT. THE SEA STAIRS - CONTINUOUS**

75 feet up. The men are exhausted, trembling under the weight.

**MAN-AT-ARMS #2**  
How much farther?

**MAN-AT-ARMS #1**  
Another hundred feet. Keep—

A MASSIVE STONE drops from above. It hits the top of the mantlet with a sound like thunder.

The wood SPLINTERS. One plank cracks completely. The stone punches through, glances off MAN-AT-ARMS #3's shoulder. He screams, loses his grip on the mantlet.

---

**EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS**

Herbert leans forward, intensely focused.

**HERBERT**  
Did you see where it hit? The angle?

**THOMAS**  
My lord, the mantlet is breaking—

**HERBERT**  
Yes, but where? The structural weak point—that's important.

Another stone drops. This one smashes through entirely, hitting MAN-AT-ARMS #4 directly. He crumples.

The mantlet tilts. On the steep stairs, with wounded men, the weight becomes impossible to control.

---

**EXT. THE SEA STAIRS - CONTINUOUS**

**MAN-AT-ARMS #1**  
(desperate)  
HOLD IT! HOLD—

The mantlet slides sideways. The edge of the stairs is right there—open air and an 80-foot drop.

MAN-AT-ARMS #3, already wounded, loses his footing. He and the mantlet tip over the edge.

His scream cuts off when he hits the rocks below.

MAN-AT-ARMS #4, the one struck by the stone, tumbles down the stairs unconscious, hits a landing, rolls again. His body comes to rest halfway down, twisted.

The two surviving men-at-arms scramble back down, arrows chasing them.

---

**EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS**

Soldiers rush to recover the bodies. One dead from the fall, one from the stone impact. The survivors are being helped back, one bleeding badly.

Herbert is already talking to Thomas, animated.

**HERBERT**  
The top-down force—we didn't account for that. If we reinforce the upper surface, or perhaps a peaked design? Like a roof? The stones would deflect rather than punch through.

**SIR EDMUND**  
(voice shaking)  
Two men are dead, my lord.

**HERBERT**  
(turning to him)  
Yes. But now we know the weakness. That's valuable.

**SIR EDMUND**  
Valuable? Two men—

**HERBERT**  
Would have died for nothing if we don't learn from it. This tells us exactly what to fix.

Sir Edmund stares at him, speechless.

**HERBERT (CONT'D)**  
(to Thomas)  
How long to build the peaked version?

**THOMAS**  
(quietly)  
...Five days, my lord.

**HERBERT**  
Excellent. Let's begin.

He walks away, already sketching in his journal.

The Master-at-Arms watches soldiers carry away the dead.

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
(to Sir Edmund)  
He doesn't feel it. Doesn't feel anything.

**SIR EDMUND**  
I know.

---

**INT. HERBERT'S TENT - NIGHT**

Herbert works by candlelight, drawing the improved design. A peaked roof, reinforced beams. He's completely absorbed.

Outside, we hear CRYING—a soldier mourning his friend who died on the stairs.

Herbert doesn't notice. He makes a note, satisfied with the solution.

---

**EXT. BEACH BELOW HARLECH - DAY (ONE WEEK LATER)**

The new mantlet is ready. Peaked roof, iron bands on the ridge. Six men this time to carry the heavier structure.

Herbert watches eagerly. Officers stand with him, grim.

**HERBERT**  
This should work much better.

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
(flat)  
Should.

The signal is given. The six men begin their ascent.

---

**EXT. THE SEA STAIRS - CONTINUOUS**

The climb is even harder—the peaked mantlet is heavier. But they make steady progress.

50 feet. 75 feet. 100 feet.

Stones rain down. This time they HIT the peaked surface and deflect to either side. It's working.

**MAN-AT-ARMS #5**  
(excited despite himself)  
It's holding!

120 feet. Three-quarters of the way up.

Then the defenders adapt.

---

**EXT. HARLECH CASTLE WALLS - CONTINUOUS**

Dafydd watches the mantlet ascend. He turns to his men.

**DAFYDD**  
(in Welsh, subtitled)  
Boiling water. Down the sides.

---

**EXT. THE SEA STAIRS - CONTINUOUS**

A cascade of BOILING WATER pours down. It runs along the sloped roof of the mantlet, streams down both sides.

The men underneath SCREAM. The water finds gaps in the design, drips through onto them.

**MAN-AT-ARMS #6**  
(agonized)  
GOD! IT BURNS!

One man releases his corner, clawing at his scalded face. The mantlet lurches.

They try to compensate but more water comes. Then BURNING PITCH.

The pitch splashes across the mantlet roof. A torch is dropped. The entire structure ignites.

---

**EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS**

Herbert watches the mantlet burn on the stairs. Men are abandoning it, scrambling down. Two are badly burned, one isn't moving.

**HERBERT**  
(to Thomas)  
Interesting. The peaked design worked against stones but created channels for liquids. And we made it more flammable with the reinforcement pitch.

**THOMAS**  
(horrified)  
My lord, they're burning—

**HERBERT**  
Yes. We need to account for fire. Perhaps wet hides instead of wood? Or...

He trails off, thinking.

Sir Edmund turns away, hand over his mouth.

---

**EXT. BEACH - LATER**

Soldiers tend to the burned men. One is screaming. One is silent, skin blackened.

Herbert approaches the survivors.

**HERBERT**  
(to the most coherent one)  
When the water hit—could you tell it was boiling immediately? Or was there a delay in sensation?

The man stares at him, face blistered.

**BURNED SOLDIER**  
(whispered)  
...What?

**HERBERT**  
The boiling water. I'm trying to understand the reaction time. Whether you could have—

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
(grabbing Herbert's arm)  
My lord. Leave him.

**HERBERT**  
(genuinely confused)  
I just want to understand what happened. So we can—

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
(very quietly, very controlled)  
Leave. Him. Now.

Herbert looks at the Master-at-Arms' face, sees something that makes him step back.

**HERBERT**  
...Of course. We can discuss it later.

He walks away. The Master-at-Arms kneels beside the burned soldier.

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
(to the soldier)  
Surgeon's coming. You did well.

The soldier just stares at nothing.

---

**INT. HERBERT'S COMMAND TENT - NIGHT**

Herbert, Thomas, and reluctant officers discuss the failures.

**HERBERT**  
Three attempts. Stone defense fails from above. Peaked design deflects stones but channels fire. Each attempt teaches us something critical.

**SIR EDMUND**  
Six men dead, my lord. Eight more crippled from burns.

**HERBERT**  
I know. But we're close to a solution. Perhaps—

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
(interrupting)  
No.

Silence. Herbert looks at him, surprised.

**MASTER-AT-ARMS (CONT'D)**  
No more men up those stairs with wooden shields. It doesn't work. It will never work.

**HERBERT**  
But we're learning what—

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
You're learning. They're dying.

**HERBERT**  
That's how we solve problems. Trial and error. That's how—

**SIR EDMUND**  
(standing)  
My lord. We need a different approach. The sea stairs are a death trap.

**HERBERT**  
(frustrated)  
Of course they are! That's why I'm trying to solve it! If we just give up after a few failures—

**MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
A few FAILURES? My lord, fourteen men are dead testing YOUR curiosity!

**HERBERT**  
(genuinely not understanding)  
But that's what soldiers do. They risk their lives for the mission. How is this different?

The officers stare at him.

**THOMAS**  
(quietly)  
Because there is no mission, my lord. We're not trying to take the castle this way. We're just... testing. For your curiosity.

Long silence. Herbert looks around at their faces.

**HERBERT**  
You think I'm wasting their lives.

**SIR EDMUND**  
(carefully)  
We think... perhaps we should try a different approach entirely.

Herbert thinks about this. Then nods slowly.

**HERBERT**  
You're right. The mantlet approach has diminishing returns. We've learned what we can from it.

The officers relax slightly, relieved.

**HERBERT (CONT'D)**  
I have a better idea anyway. Something bigger.

He spreads a new drawing on the table. The officers lean in, then freeze.

Fifty trebuchets.

**HERBERT (CONT'D)**  
We'll need to start construction immediately.

The officers look at each other, trapped.

FADE TO BLACK.
